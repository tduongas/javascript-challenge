# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

That's why we are hiring you. We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

You can handle this... right? The planet Earth needs to know what we have found!

## Task

### Preparation

1. Created a new repository for this project called `javascript-challenge`.

2. Clone the new repository.

3. Creates directories for the Javascript challenge. Used the folder names to correspond to the challenges: **UFO-level-1** and **UFO-level-2**.

4. Added **html** files to this folder as well as your static folder containing javascript. This will be the main script to run for analysis.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Created a basic HTML web page or using the [index.html](StarterCode/index.html). 

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, code was written to append to a table and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Columns for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` were added.

* A date form in the HTML document was added and JavaScript code implemented that listens for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Completed all of Level 1 criteria.

* Used multiple `input` tags, wrote JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
